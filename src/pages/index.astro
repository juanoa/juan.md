    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
      I work on the founding team at MITO, designing and building interfaces for
      our first customers next to amazing people like Danny Saltaren, Dani
      Latorre, Nacho González and Keyvan Akbari.
    </p>
    <p>
      I previously worked at Inditex (zara.com) crafting the interfaces of the
      product and catalog management tool for all the e-commerces in the
      company.

    <h2>A man on a mission</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always trusted technology, not just as a tool, but as an extension of
      human intent. Some learned to fear it. I chose to believe in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology reflects who we are. In the right hands, it gives people
      agency, clarity, and the power to shape their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would it take to reclaim the web as a space for creativity, intimacy
      and intellectualism?
