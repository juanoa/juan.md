    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m Juan and I work in technology. I’m a Computer Engineer by
      profession and I build digital products, currently for MITO. Until October
      2025 I was part of the Inditex team.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always knew I wanted to do what I do. Choosing my studies was easy and I
      never doubted where I wanted to go. However, programming isn’t something
      that excites me on its own. I see programming—code—as a means to an end,
      and I believe engineers have a far more noble objective than simply
      developing. We have the challenging role of being the bridge between
      technology and society.
    </p>

    <h2>Main achievements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Zara Boost</strong>: Winning the <a

        > allowed me to start working at the company (over 3,000 participants, 20
        winners).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1st National Cyberleague</strong>: Finalist in the <a

        > organized by the Spanish Civil Guard.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Projects I’m most proud of</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inditex catalog management tool</strong>. This is where I
        started building real product. Everything I know about development,
        product, and design I learned here. We built one of the highest-rated
        tools in the company, from which one of the world’s largest e-commerce
        platforms could be managed: Zara.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Omnia</strong>. A tool for analyzing brand positioning in LLMs.
        I collaborated with Daniel Espejo in the early stages of defining and
        developing the product. (<a

        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>COVID vaccination bot</strong>. A Twitter bot I built during the
        COVID-19 pandemic to report on the vaccination status in Spain (<a

        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wateralo</strong>. While at university, I co-founded a reusable
        water bottle brand with two classmates. We handled everything: sourcing,
        logistics, website, shipping, marketing, and more. It was an amazing
        experience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other projects</h3>
    <p>Other small side projects I have published online:</p>

    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Some basic facts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I was born on <strong>May 25, 1999</strong>, in <strong>Alicante</strong
        >
        (Spain), but I moved to Murcia a few years later.
      </li>
      <li>
        After studying Computer Engineering, I was accepted into Inditex’s
        talent program and moved to A Coruña (Galicia, Spain), <strong
          >where I feel at home</strong
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moving to A Coruña taught me that <strong
          >stepping out of my comfort zone</strong
        > is scary, but the results are worth it.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the last few years, I’ve become very active. I climb, run, and surf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since I started surfing, the <strong>sea</strong> has become my favorite
        place in the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two years ago, I bought a <strong>piano</strong>, and since then I’ve
        enjoyed music even more.
      </li>
      <li>
        I like to set new challenges and goals from time to time to keep growing
        both personally and professionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m addicted to <strong>Notion</strong>; I manage my whole life from
        there.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My values working in technology</h2>
    <p>
      What truly makes the difference are the people, the culture, and the way
      we work. These are the values I try to apply every day to build with
      purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>What motivates me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The product is key</strong>. I need to believe in the product
        I’m building and how it can positively impact society.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <strong>multidisciplinary</strong> environment where, even though each
        person has their own strengths, we can share opinions in different areas
        like design or business.
      </li>
      <li>
        I value when the engineering team can <strong
          >interact with users and the business</strong
        > without intermediaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        I love <strong>starting projects from scratch</strong>, applying the
        Pareto principle to quickly achieve 80% of the results with 20% of the
        effort.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What disappoints me</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hierarchies and <strong>unnecessary bureaucracy</strong>. It overwhelms
        me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Over-engineering, spending more time on implementation than solving the
        real problem, and <strong
          >teams that prioritize technical solutions over functional ones</strong
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I stand out at <strong
          >understanding the business and its main pain points</strong
        >, translating them into solutions that address real problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m good at <strong>translating business language into code</strong>,
        making it more maintainable and scalable. <em
          >If someone in business understood programming, they should be able to
          understand our code</em
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Areas for improvement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Due to my multidisciplinary approach, I haven’t spent 100% of my time
        becoming the most technically advanced. Instead, I’ve also chosen to
        focus on areas like design, product, complex problem solving, and
        communication. In other words, <strong
          >I might never be the best developer</strong
        > on the team.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      I believe work is <strong>more than earning a salary</strong>. It’s about
      contributing to society, helping groups with their problems, and helping
      them grow. It’s also a way to grow individually and make the most of our
      potential. This isn’t about serving a system; it’s about serving yourself.
      As Rosalía says, “craft and mastery”:

      Thanks for making it this far. I’ve always liked how Apple does
      advertising, especially in the Jobs era. I didn’t talk about it, but it’s
      one of my favorite brands. Here’s one of my favorite ads:
